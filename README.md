## LIVELINK FACE FOR METAHUMAN FACIAL ANIMATION ##

- Livelink is a feature of Unreal Engine enabling real-time data streaming from external sources. It enables live facial animation capture, motion capture and other dynamic data inputs to be directly applied to a virtual character which enhances its the realism and expressiveness.   
   
Example of real time data streaming through LiveLink:

- In this project, the aim of using Live Link Face application is to capture high-fidelity facial animation from an actor through iPhone and then transfer it to the metahuman in real time.
   
Example video of the facial animation of one of the metahumans in the current project in Unreal Engine 5:

**🤯_If you are having trouble seeing your iPhone under the LiveLink Source in UE, you can apply these solutions:_**

1.	Switching your Network Profile to Private
   
Communication ports needs to be open to have a proper connection between Unreal Engine and your phone. Selecting your network profile to "Private" rather than "Public" can enable the communication between Unreal Engine and your phone.
   
2.	Opening UDP Port P11111
   
P11111 is a UDP port that Unreal Engine LiveLink feature uses to communicate with the devices on the network. Opening this port from computer`s firewall for the specific IP address of your phone can result flowing of data between UE and your phone.
